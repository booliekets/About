# About Me

Hello! I'm Boolie, a passionate digital content creator and web designer. 🌐 I specialize in WordPress web design and love helping others build their online presence with ease. You can find tutorials and tips on my YouTube channel, "Doodling Web Designs." ✨

In addition to my technical skills, I'm a proud mom and enjoy creating content for multiple YouTube channels covering topics from pets 🐦🐾 to natural skincare 🌿 and medicinal herbal teas 🍵. I'm also an avid photographer 📸, capturing the beauty of nature and selling prints on Redbubble and Etsy. 🌸🦋

My journey in holistic wellness began after discovering the power of natural remedies and clean living. 🧘‍♀️ I share my experiences and tips on my Wellness Herbal Blends channel, aiming to inspire others to embrace a healthier lifestyle. 🌱💚

I'm constantly learning and exploring new ways to enhance my skills and share my knowledge with the world. My dream is to eventually go full-time on one of my YouTube channels while continuing to create engaging digital content. 🌏✨

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me! 🚀
